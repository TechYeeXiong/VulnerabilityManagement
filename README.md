Go to the Marketplace → “OpenVAS secured and supported by HOSSTED”
“Start with a pre-set configuration” → Pick the weakest one
“Continue to Create VM”
Resource Group: Vulnerability-Management
VM Name: OpenVAS (Take note of the region and Vnet–consider East US 2)
Authentication: Create a username and password
Monitoring: Disable Boot Diagnostic (don’t need it)
Click Create
After the VM has been created, SSH into it With PowerShell (windows) or Terminal (MacOS) using the credentials you created earlier by typing <Credential@PublicIPAddress>

</p>
<p>
Use the ICMP protocol as the filter to observe the traffic. Open Windows Powershell then use "ping 10.0.0.5" and "ping www.google.com". Next go to VM2's network security group and create an inbound security rule to deny ICMP traffic. These commands will show how much data is being sent and received.

</p>
<p>
Use SSH to filter the traffic. In Powershell, use SSH to remotely connect to VM2 by typing "ssh labuser@10.0.0.5". Next type "pwd", "id", and "ls -lasth". Observe the traffic.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Use DHCP to filter the traffic. In Powershell, type "ipconfig /renew" then observe the traffic.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/f06KkBn.jpg" height="80%" width="80%" alt="DNS"/>
</p>
<p>
Use DNS to filter the traffic. In Powershell, type "nslookup www.google.com" and "nslookup www.disney.com" to find the IP Address for both website and observe the traffic.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
In order to use RDP in the filter; you type in "tcp.port == 3389". Since RDP was selected as the protocol for VM1 when it was created; the rdp filter will spam nonstop. Every movement or words being typed inside the virtual machine will cause traffic to be sent.
